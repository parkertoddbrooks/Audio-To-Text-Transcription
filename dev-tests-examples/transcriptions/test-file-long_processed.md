Heber: Say there. What brings you by?

I understand. You're right, and I apologize for the confusion earlier. Summarize the key points we discussed about the pipeline and royalty payment model:

1. 15 line overview 
2. User selects 10 songs via Apple music API
3. Right data retrieved from Apple music SDK model 
4. Training Music generation based on selected songs and larger model
5. Post-processing and Publishing to platoon 
6. Distribution on Apple music to 33% of royalties
7. Go to the larger model training data set

I understand you've discovered something new that has you feeling template is a bit uncomfortable and slightly doubtful. I apologize for the misunderstanding. You're right the correct me, please go ahead and explain I'm listening attentively and won't interrupt. I'm here to understand your perspective. 

Distributed Pro rata 67% of royalties go to rights holders of the 10 specific songs used the two handles automatic splitting and distribution of royalties three key components to build:

1. User interface for song selection integration with apple 
2. Music API n s t k a i model 4 music generation 
3. Publishing and distribution system through platoon royalty tracking distribution system

Is there a specific aspect of this summer you'd like me to expand on further?

Certainly I understand your reaction. It seems like you're feeling a mix of confusion doubt and positive surprise about our conversation or the system. We've been discussing. Of course, I'd be happy to help what favor did you have in mind? I'm here and ready to assist with whatever you need.  

I sense you're feeling a b. The key components and their interactions. I'm listening carefully and ready to help her find the technical aspects based on your specific requirements. 

Hws KMS, where do you find quicksand is his technical pipeline align what you had in mind you like me to elaborate on any specific component?

Tripping I apologize for misunderstanding your needs earlier. Let's revisit the pipeline concept. I'm ready to listen and understand what you have in mind for a more accurate technical pipeline. 

I apologize for missing the mark earlier. Let's revisit the pipeline and breakdown how all the pieces would work together. Please go ahead and describe your vision for the pipeline focusing. You again similar architecture for music generation:

I understand you're looking for a technical pipe on using a WS. Here's a high-level overview:

1. User interface web application using react or similar framework integrate with apple music API for song search and selection 
2. Server know dies or python application on ec2 or ECS handles user requests and orchestrate some pipeline 
3. Data processing AWS Lambda functions for data preparation convert selected songs to spectrograms using libros the library for training 
4. Amazon sagemaker for model development and training

Okay. Got it. Thank you for explaining that process. Thank you for spending the full process. Okay, I understand now. Thank you for explaining that let me summarize the pipeline based on your description. 

Web interface I apologize for interrupting. Please continue with your explanation about the larger model. I apologize for jumping to head. So please continue with your explanation about the larger model listening and one interrupts. 

I understand the flow now:
1. User select

User uploads 10 songs through the web interface.

The Shazam SDK is used to automatically identify and associate each uploaded song with its Apple music counterpart.

If Shazam can't find a match, user has two options:
- Manually search Apple music and select the correct matching song
- Delete the unmatched song from the list

The process can only continue once all uploaded songs have been successfully matched with Apple music entries. This ensures that we have accurate rights information for all songs used in the generation process.

AWS uses the 10 matched songs as predominant weights for new song generation.

The larger model is also used in generation, but with less influence.

The newly generated song is returned to the web interface.

User can choose to play or publish the new song.

If published, the process continues as previously discussed:
- Audio file for the new song is sent to Platoon via REST calls
- Rights split info from Apple music SDK is sent to Platoon
- Platoon handles distribution and royalty management

This process combines user-provided content with the Apple music catalog for AI music generation.

Is there anything you'd like to add or modify in this summary?

Thank you for completing the explanation. I understand the full process now. I'll provide a comprehensive pipeline PRD with the technologies needed and steps to follow.

I understand your interest in existing open-source models trained on large volumes of music.  Let me provide some information on this topic.  Currently there isn't a single comprehensive open-source model train than a large volume of music that's ready for production used in the way you described.

Use your applications.

Each section can be expanded into more detail technical specifications as development progresses. I apologize for the confusion earlier.  You're right to ask for clarification on the specific model for song creation.

A wide range of genres and styles for jukebox generates music with vocals trained in a large data set of Psalms 5 wave RNN focuses on generating raw. Audio waveform can be trained on various music data sets. These models could potentially serve as a starting point or replacement for the Apple Music Channel log in your pipe on however, keep in mind that they may have limitations in terms of John real coverage are audio quality compared to a comprehensive commercial catalog. 

Would you like more details on any of these models or information on how to integrate them into your pipeline? And you're looking for an open source alternative to using the Apple music catalog for training the music generation mop.  

So let me provide some information on existing open-source models for music generation. There are several open-source models trained on large volumes of music do they may not be as comprehensive as the entire Apple music catalog for a few options. 

1 magenta includes models like music Transformer music. They eat rained on various midi datasets can generate Melodies and harmonies to Abba on that fully open source. They have released some models trained on classical music compositions 3 News Net can generate 4minute musical compositions. Post-processing adjust audio to match desired length Temple Etc to waiting the 10 songs more heavily would be in the input processing and model fine-tuning stages. 

We need to develop a custom waiting system in the future extraction and model and put faces. Does this help clarify the model and process would you like more details and any specific part of this pipeline?

The music generation model this would be fine-tuned on the 10 uploaded songs to capture their specific musical characteristics to the audio synthesis model. This wou

Here is the transcript part reformatted for better readability:

ld be fine tune to better reproduced the sound qualities of the 10 uploaded songs, the fine-tuning process allows these models to better capture and reproduce the aspects of the 10m put songs ensuring the generated music is more heavily influenced by them while still leveraging the broader Knowledge from the larger catalog. 

Would you like me to elaborate on the fine-tuning process or either of these models or perhaps you're interested in discussing a different aspect of the pipeline? Do you referring to is likely Hi-Fi Gann which is indeed using audio synthesis for the pipeline you're describing. We likely use a combination of models. 1 and 4 overall music structure and composition a model like music Transformer or music be24 audio synthesis. Hi-Fi Gaynor a similar vocoder model the pipeline might work like this one in book processing extra features from the 10th load at songs for a larger catalog data to composition generation using music Transformer model getting higher way to features from the 10 songs generator musical structure 3 Audio synthesis use Hi-Fi again to convert the generated structure into high-quality audium fine.

Tune Hi-Fi again on the 10 songs for style Matthew 4. here to chat  how to  Thanks for clarifying.  When I mentioned model fine-tuning stages, I was referring to fine-tuning to Maine models. I apologize for the confusion.  You're right to seek clarification.  Let me be more precise. We're not necessarily using three separate Transformer models instead. We're looking at a pipeline a typically involves two main components one and use a generation model to audio synthesis model. The process doesn't require three separate Transformer models working together. I should have been clear about that. 

Could you tell me more about what you had in mind for the modern architecture? I'm interested in understanding. Vision for how these components should work together to achieve the desired result of generating music heavily influenced by the 10in folk songs while still using the larger catalog.  

Sure.  breakdown pipeline walkway, little one  Input process since we take the 10 uploaded songs and extract their musical features. We also have features from the larger music catalog to I under Purpose converts the musical structure into actual audio input the symbolic representation from the music generation model output the final audio file of the generated song. These models are trained on large data sets and then fine-tune on the 10m boot songs to better capture their style. 

Is this explanation clear? Do you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this process?  descent Part of the pipeline that manages communication between these algorithms is typically a workflow orchestration system or a custom-built pipeline manager. This component is responsible for one coordinating data flow between different stages to triggering each model or algorithm at the appropriate time 3 handling any errors are exceptions for managing the waiting of inputs five orchestrating the fine-tuning process for each model, and Technologies used for this purpose include Apache airflow. Koplo custom Python scripts using libraries like a Ouija or prefect this Central component ensures that the output from one stage is properly formatted in fed into the next stage. It also manages the overall process well from initial impulse 25 

Would you like more details on how this Central component might be implemented in your specific pipeline?  You're absolutely right.  The python project essential component would typically be implemented in the main Don py script in the source folder.  This crap would serve as the entry point norkus traitor for the entire pipeline. 

There's a basic outline of what this main you want. And you're looking for a clear explanation of the pipeline in the models involved me break it down more precisely. I've run overview on and put 10 years or selected sounds plus larger music catalog to feature extraction convert audio to usable
