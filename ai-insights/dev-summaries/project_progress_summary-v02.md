# Audio-To-Text Project Progress Summary - v01

## Project Overview
The Audio-To-Text project is an innovative tool designed to transcribe audio files into text. It aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for converting spoken content into written form, with support for both short audio clips (free version) and longer audio files (paid version using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API).

## Current Status
- CLI application has been developed and is functional for both free and paid versions
- Project structure has been refined to include separate scripts for free and paid versions
- Installation and usage instructions have been updated and clarified
- Error handling and user experience have been improved

## Key Features
- Support for both MP3 and WAV audio formats
- Free version for transcribing short audio clips (10-15 seconds) using Google's Speech Recognition API
- Paid version for transcribing longer audio files using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- Automatic audio format conversion (MP3 to WAV) when necessary
- User-friendly command-line interface for choosing between free and paid versions
- Clear error messages and handling for common issues

## Technology Stack
- Python for core application development
- FFmpeg and FFprobe for audio file handling
- SpeechRecognition library for the free version
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for the paid version
- pydub library for audio file manipulation

## Recent Developments
1. Implemented a dual-version system allowing users to choose between free and paid options
2. Created a main script to handle user input and launch the appropriate version
3. Updated installation instructions to use a requirements.txt file
4. Improved error handling and user feedback in both versions
5. Refined project documentation for clearer setup and usage instructions

## Next Steps
1. Implement audio splitting functionality for processing long files in chunks (paid version)
2. Add support for more audio file formats
3. Create a user-friendly graphical interface
4. Implement batch processing capabilities for multiple audio files
5. Add options for custom vocabulary or industry-specific terminology (paid version)

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Managing dependencies for both free and paid versions
  Solution: Created a comprehensive requirements.txt file and updated installation instructions

- Challenge: Handling longer audio files
  Solution: Implemented paid version using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API

- Challenge: User experience for version selection
  Solution: Developed a main script to guide users through the process

## Limitations of Current Version
1. Free version is limited to short audio clips (10-15 seconds)
2. Paid version requires setup of Google Cloud account and API credentials
3. No batch processing capabilities for multiple files
4. Limited to command-line interface

## Conclusion
The Audio-To-Text project has made significant progress in providing a versatile tool for audio transcription. By offering both free and paid options, it caters to a wide range of user needs, from quick transcriptions of short clips to processing longer, more complex audio files. The project is well-positioned for future enhancements, including improved user interfaces, support for additional audio formats, and more advanced transcription features.

The focus for the next phase of development will be on enhancing the tool's capabilities, particularly for the paid version, and improving overall user experience. By addressing these areas, the Audio-To-Text project aims to become a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for audio transcription tasks across various use cases and industries.
