# Audio-To-Text Project Progress Summary - v05

## Project Overview
The Audio-To-Text project is an innovative CLI tool designed to transcribe audio files into text. It provides an efficient and accurate solution for converting spoken content into written form, with support for both short audio clips (free version) and longer audio files (paid version using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API).

## Current Status
- CLI application is fully functional for both free and paid versions
- Support for multiple audio formats, including M4A, has been successfully implemented and tested
- Project structure has been refined with updated script names
- Interactive user interface for file saving has been implemented
- Transcription output includes word count, audio duration, and confidence score
- Recent bug with M4A file processing in the free version has been resolved

## Key Features
- Command-line interface for easy integration into workflows and scripts
- Support for multiple audio formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WMA, AIFF, AIF, AMR
- Free version for transcribing short audio clips using Google's Speech Recognition API
- Paid version for transcribing longer audio files using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- Automatic audio format conversion to WAV when necessary
- User-friendly CLI with colorful output using the rich library
- Interactive prompts for saving transcriptions with custom directory and format options
- Display of word count, audio duration, and confidence score for transcriptions

## Technology Stack
- Python for core application development
- FFmpeg for audio file handling and conversion
- SpeechRecognition library for the free version
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for the paid version
- pydub library for audio file manipulation
- rich library for enhanced CLI output
- wave module for audio duration calculation
- tempfile module for handling temporary files during audio processing

## Recent Developments
1. Resolved issue with M4A file processing in the free version
2. Improved audio file handling using temporary files
3. Enhanced error handling and debugging output
4. Refactored code for better modularity and readability
5. Ensured consistent functionality across different audio formats

## Next Steps
1. Conduct thorough testing of all supported audio formats in both free and paid versions
2. Implement similar interactive features for the paid version (google-api.py)
3. Consider adding batch processing capabilities for multiple audio files
4. Explore options for improving transcription accuracy
5. Implement more robust error handling and logging
6. Optimize performance for longer audio files

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Processing M4A files in the free version
  Solution: Implemented a more robust audio conversion process using temporary files

- Challenge: Ensuring consistent functionality across different audio formats
  Solution: Refactored audio processing code to handle various formats uniformly

- Challenge: Managing memory usage for larger audio files
  Solution: Utilized temporary files and improved file handling to reduce memory footprint

## Limitations of Current Version
1. Free version is still limited to short audio clips due to API constraints
2. Paid version requires setup of Google Cloud account and API credentials
3. No batch processing capabilities for multiple files yet
4. Transcription accuracy may vary depending on audio quality and speech clarity

## Conclusion
The Audio-To-Text project has made significant strides in providing a versatile and user-friendly CLI tool for audio transcription. Recent improvements in audio file handling, particularly for M4A files, have enhanced the tool's reliability and expanded its compatibility. The project now offers a more robust solution for transcribing various audio formats in both free and paid versions.

The focus for the next phase of development will be on implementing similar improvements for the paid version, conducting thorough testing across all supported audio formats, and exploring ways to improve transcription accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, optimizing performance for longer audio files and implementing batch processing capabilities will be key areas of focus. By addressing these areas, the Audio-To-Text project aims to become an even more powerful and efficient solution for audio transcription tasks across various use cases and industries.
