# Audio-To-Text Project Progress Summary - v04

## Project Overview
The Audio-To-Text project is an innovative CLI tool designed to transcribe audio files into text. It provides an efficient and accurate solution for converting spoken content into written form, with support for both short audio clips (free version) and longer audio files (paid version using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API).

## Current Status
- CLI application has been developed and is functional for both free and paid versions
- Support for multiple audio formats has been implemented
- Project structure has been refined with updated script names
- Interactive user interface for file saving has been implemented
- Transcription output now includes word count, audio duration, and confidence score

## Key Features
- Command-line interface for easy integration into workflows and scripts
- Support for multiple audio formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WMA, AIFF, AIF, AMR
- Free version for transcribing short audio clips using Google's Speech Recognition API
- Paid version for transcribing longer audio files using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- Automatic audio format conversion to WAV when necessary
- User-friendly CLI with colorful output using the rich library
- Interactive prompts for saving transcriptions with custom directory and format options
- Display of word count, audio duration, and confidence score for transcriptions

## Technology Stack
- Python for core application development
- FFmpeg for audio file handling and conversion
- SpeechRecognition library for the free version
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for the paid version
- pydub library for audio file manipulation
- rich library for enhanced CLI output
- wave module for audio duration calculation

## Recent Developments
1. Implemented interactive prompts for saving transcriptions
2. Added display of word count, audio duration, and confidence score
3. Improved user input handling with consistent option formatting
4. Enhanced error handling and directory creation for file saving
5. Refactored code for better modularity and readability

## Next Steps
1. Conduct thorough testing of all supported audio formats
2. Implement similar interactive features for the paid version (google-api.py)
3. Consider adding batch processing capabilities for multiple audio files
4. Explore options for improving transcription accuracy
5. Implement more robust error handling and logging

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Creating a user-friendly CLI experience
  Solution: Implemented interactive prompts and consistent option formatting

- Challenge: Providing more detailed transcription information
  Solution: Added word count, audio duration, and confidence score to the output

- Challenge: Handling various user inputs and file saving scenarios
  Solution: Developed a flexible user input function and improved file saving logic

## Limitations of Current Version
1. Free version is still limited to short audio clips
2. Paid version requires setup of Google Cloud account and API credentials
3. No batch processing capabilities for multiple files yet
4. Transcription accuracy may vary depending on audio quality and speech clarity

## Conclusion
The Audio-To-Text project has made significant progress in providing a versatile and user-friendly CLI tool for audio transcription. The recent improvements in user interaction, particularly for file saving options, have enhanced the overall user experience. The addition of word count, audio duration, and confidence score provides users with more comprehensive information about their transcriptions.

The focus for the next phase of development will be on implementing similar improvements for the paid version, conducting thorough testing across all supported audio formats, and exploring ways to improve transcription accuracy and efficiency. By addressing these areas, the Audio-To-Text project aims to become an even more robust and efficient solution for audio transcription tasks across various use cases and industries.
