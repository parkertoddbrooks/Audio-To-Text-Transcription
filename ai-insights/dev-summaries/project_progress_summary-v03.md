# Audio-To-Text Project Progress Summary - v03

## Project Overview
The Audio-To-Text project is an innovative CLI tool designed to transcribe audio files into text. It provides an efficient and accurate solution for converting spoken content into written form, with support for both short audio clips (free version) and longer audio files (paid version using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API).

## Current Status
- CLI application has been developed and is functional for both free and paid versions
- Support for multiple audio formats has been implemented
- Project structure has been refined with updated script names
- Installation and usage instructions have been updated and clarified
- Error handling and user experience have been improved

## Key Features
- Command-line interface for easy integration into workflows and scripts
- Support for multiple audio formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WMA, AIFF, AIF, AMR
- Free version for transcribing short audio clips using Google's Speech Recognition API
- Paid version for transcribing longer audio files using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- Automatic audio format conversion to WAV when necessary
- User-friendly CLI with colorful output using the rich library
- Clear error messages and handling for common issues

## Technology Stack
- Python for core application development
- FFmpeg for audio file handling and conversion
- SpeechRecognition library for the free version
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for the paid version
- pydub library for audio file manipulation
- rich library for enhanced CLI output

## Recent Developments
1. Implemented support for multiple audio formats
2. Updated main script (main.py) to handle various audio formats
3. Refactored transcription scripts with new names (google-api-free.py and google-api.py)
4. Enhanced user interface with colorful output using the rich library
5. Improved error handling and user feedback in both versions
6. Updated project documentation for clearer setup and usage instructions

## Next Steps
1. Conduct thorough testing of all supported audio formats
2. Implement batch processing capabilities for multiple audio files
3. Add options for custom vocabulary or industry-specific terminology (paid version)
4. Explore options for improving transcription accuracy
5. Consider implementing a progress bar for longer transcriptions

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Supporting multiple audio formats
  Solution: Implemented audio conversion using pydub and FFmpeg

- Challenge: Enhancing user experience in CLI
  Solution: Integrated the rich library for colorful and formatted output

- Challenge: Maintaining separate codebases for free and paid versions
  Solution: Refactored code to share common functionality while keeping version-specific features separate

## Limitations of Current Version
1. Free version is still limited to short audio clips
2. Paid version requires setup of Google Cloud account and API credentials
3. No batch processing capabilities for multiple files yet
4. Transcription accuracy may vary depending on audio quality and speech clarity

## Conclusion
The Audio-To-Text project has made significant progress in providing a versatile CLI tool for audio transcription. By supporting a wide range of audio formats and offering both free and paid options, it caters to various user needs. The recent improvements in user interface and error handling have enhanced the overall user experience.

The focus for the next phase of development will be on thorough testing, implementing batch processing, and exploring ways to improve transcription accuracy. By addressing these areas, the Audio-To-Text project aims to become an even more robust and efficient solution for audio transcription tasks across various use cases and industries.
