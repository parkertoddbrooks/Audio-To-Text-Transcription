# Audio-To-Text Project Progress Summary - v08

## Project Overview
The Audio-To-Text project is an innovative CLI tool designed to transcribe audio files into text. It provides an efficient and accurate solution for converting spoken content into written form, with support for both short audio clips (free version) and longer audio files (paid version using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API). The project is now expanding to include Whisper by OpenAI for improved transcription capabilities.

## Current Status
- CLI application is fully functional for both free and paid versions
- Support for multiple audio formats has been successfully implemented and tested
- Long audio file processing has been optimized using chunking and parallel processing
- Project structure has been refined with updated script names
- Interactive user interface for file saving has been implemented
- Transcription output includes word count, audio duration, and confidence score (where applicable)
- Post-processing feature using Claude Opus 3 has been added for enhanced formatting and error correction
- Integration of Whisper by OpenAI is in progress for improved transcription accuracy

## Key Features
- Command-line interface for easy integration into workflows and scripts
- Support for multiple audio formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WMA, AIFF, AIF, AMR
- Free version for transcribing short audio clips using Google's Speech Recognition API
- Paid version for transcribing longer audio files using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- Automatic audio format conversion to WAV when necessary
- Chunking of long audio files for efficient processing
- Parallel processing of audio chunks for faster transcription
- User-friendly CLI with colorful output using the rich library
- Interactive prompts for saving transcriptions with custom directory and format options
- Display of word count, audio duration, and confidence score for transcriptions (where applicable)
- Post-processing option using Claude Opus 3 for improved readability and error correction
- Upcoming Whisper integration for enhanced transcription accuracy

## Technology Stack
- Python for core application development
- FFmpeg for audio file handling and conversion
- SpeechRecognition library for the free version
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API (v1p1beta1) for the paid version
- pydub library for audio file manipulation and chunking
- concurrent.futures for parallel processing
- rich library for enhanced CLI output
- tempfile module for handling temporary files during audio processing
- Anthropic's Claude API for post-processing transcriptions
- dotenv for managing environment variables
- Whisper by OpenAI (integration in progress) for improved transcription
