# Fixing ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.protobuf.pyext' in Python 3.12

This guide provides steps to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.protobuf.pyext'` error when using the google-cloud-speech library with Python 3.12.

## Error Description

When running the Audio-To-Text Transcription tool with Python 3.12, you may encounter the following error:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.protobuf.pyext'
```

This error occurs due to compatibility issues between the Google Protobuf library and Python 3.12.

## Solution Steps

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Upgrade pip and setuptools**

   First, ensure you have the latest versions of pip and setuptools:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   ```

2. **Uninstall existing google-cloud-speech and protobuf packages**

   Remove the current installations to ensure a clean slate:

   ```
   pip uninstall google-cloud-speech protobuf
   ```

3. **Install the latest compatible versions**

   Install specific versions of protobuf and google-cloud-speech that are known to work with Python 3.12:

   ```
   pip install protobuf==3.20.3
   pip install google-cloud-speech==2.21.0
   ```

4. **Verify the installation**

   Check that the packages are correctly installed:

   ```
   pip list | grep -E "protobuf|google-cloud-speech"
   ```

   You should see output similar to:
   ```
   google-cloud-speech     2.21.0
   protobuf                3.20.3
   ```

5. **Clear Python cache**

   Remove any cached `.pyc` files that might interfere:

   ```
   find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
   ```

6. **Restart your Python environment**

   If you're using a virtual environment, deactivate and reactivate it:

   ```
   deactivate
   source your_venv_name/bin/activate
   ```

   Replace `your_venv_name` with the name of your virtual environment.

7. **Test the application**

   Try running your main.py script again:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you're still encountering issues:

1. **Check Python version**

   Ensure you're using Python 3.12:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

2. **Verify PYTHONPATH**

   Make sure your PYTHONPATH is correctly set and doesn't include conflicting directories.

3. **Reinstall all dependencies**

   As a last resort, you can try reinstalling all project dependencies:

   ```
   pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Update requirements.txt**

   Update your project's `requirements.txt` file to specify the correct versions:

   ```
   protobuf==3.20.3
   google-cloud-speech==2.21.0
   ```

   Then reinstall using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
